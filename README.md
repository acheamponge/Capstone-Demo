# Demo: Emmanuel Acheampong Fall Capstone Presentation (11/12/2020)

This Demo uses the [Udacity self-driving-car dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and [YOLO object detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo) into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app to demonstrate Object Detection.

The complete demo is [implemented in less than 300 lines of Python](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/blob/master/streamlit_app.py) and illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit.
